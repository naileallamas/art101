		<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p>This Lab was to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>A challenge in this lab was to try and figure out how to think like a computer would when giving it directions on how to play the game we chose.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<h3>List of high-level tasks.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Buy bread, peanut butter, and jelly from Safeway.</p>
			<li><p>Walk home with your ingredients.</p>
			<li><p>Get out the plate and knife.</p>
			<li><p>Wash your hands.</p>
			<li><p>If you have a toaster, toast your bread.</p>
			<li><p>Lay out the two slices of bread.</p>
			<li><p>Spread the peanut butter on the first slice of bread.</p>
			<li><p>Spread the jelly on the second slice of bread.</p>
			<li><p>Combine!</p>
		</ul>

		<h3>Pseudocode a computer task</h3>
		<pre><code>
			//Identify the three options they can choose from (rock, paper, scissors)
			//Figure out all total combinations + which option overpowers the other one
			//Take in both userâ€™s input (rock, paper, scissors option)
			//Testing the win/draw condition
			//Tells which player wins (confetti!)
		</pre></code>
